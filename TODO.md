# Questions for OABF
- Are dynamics slow? Take the video [`motion_corrected.mp4`](2-denoise/motion_corrected.mp4), is really that slow? Or are there any fast dynamics events? I thought the calcium dinamycs were in the order of 100-1000ms
- What are the values in the input `tiff`?
- What is the FPS?
- How were the *denoised* version obtained?
- What do "good" and "bad" refer to in the OneDrive hierarchy?

# Questions for us
- How do we quantitatively compare predictions?
- How do we provide RT if using diffusion model?
- Does DeepCAD RT training trains DeepCAD then distillation
